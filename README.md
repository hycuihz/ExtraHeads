# ExtraGear
ExtraGear is one of the oldest Slimefun addons in existence.<br>
The features are pretty simple, it adds new weapons and armor sets for various Slimefun ingots/alloys.
These weapons and armor sets also come with enchantments!

Thanks to TheBusyBiscuit's origin code, and here is my Simplified code.
